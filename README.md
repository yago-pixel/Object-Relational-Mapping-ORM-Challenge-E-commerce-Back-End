<h1 align="center">Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End üëã</h1>
  
   
## Description
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. You‚Äôll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won‚Äôt be deployed, you‚Äôll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You‚Äôll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission GuideLinks to an external site. on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
